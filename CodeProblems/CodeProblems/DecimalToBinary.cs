		 C# Program to convert Decimal to Binary
We can convert any decimal number (base-10 (0 to 9)) into binary number (base-2 (0 or 1)) by C# program.

Decimal Number
Decimal number is a base 10 number because it ranges from 0 to 9, there are total 10 digits between 0 to 9. Any combination of digits is decimal number such as 223, 585, 192, 0, 7 etc.

Binary Number
Binary number is a base 2 number because it is either 0 or 1. Any combination of 0 and 1 is binary number such as 1001, 101, 11111, 101010 etc.

Let's see the some binary numbers for the decimal number.

Decimal	Binary
1	0
2	10
3	11
4	100
5	101
6	110
7	111
8	1000
9	1001
10	1010
Decimal to Binary Conversion Algorithm
Step 1: Divide the number by 2 through % (modulus operator) and store the remainder in array

Step 2: Divide the number by 2 through / (division operator)

Step 3: Repeat the step 2 until the number is greater than zero

Let's see the C# example to convert decimal to binary.

			Enter the number to convert:10
Binary of the given number= 1010

		public static void Main()
		{
			int n, i;
			int[] a = new int[10];
			Console.Write("Enter the number to convert: ");
			n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
			for (i = 0; n > 0; i++)
			{
				a[i] = n % 2;
				n = n / 2;
			}
			Console.Write("Binary of the given number= ");
			for (i = i - 1; i >= 0; i--)
			{
				Console.Write(a[i]);
			}
		}
